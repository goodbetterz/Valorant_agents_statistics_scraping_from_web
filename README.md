## Introduction
This repository contains one Python script that will able to scrape the Valorant agents statistics data from blitz.gg and save those data into csv file.

## Objective
To learn how to scrape data from website with Python and essential libraries.

## Python Library
- **`BeautifulSoup`** : A Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents, including those with malformed markup. It creates a parse tree for documents that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping. [**(ref: wikipedia)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beautiful_Soup_(HTML_parser))
- **`requests`** : The requests module allows you to send HTTP requests using Python. [**(ref: w3schools)**](https://www.w3schools.com/python/module_requests.asp)
- **`pandas`** : is a fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language. [**(ref: pandas.pydata.org)**](https://pandas.pydata.org/)

## Final Result
All csv file results are in the [**agents_data**](agents_data/) folder.
